# Story Shorts: narrated, ridiculous first-person Minecraft stories

The owner (2026-11-06): "can we try to ridiculous stories? like the roblox stories (blocky-stories) but with
minecraft instead?" A story Short is a 40-75 s first-person story, told by a fast narrator with big word-chunk
captions, over scenes the bot acts out on the real server. The renderer is POV only, so the narrator is the
camera, and that is the format's best trick: the viewer never sees who "I" am (pilot: `runaway`, where the
narrator turns out to be the creeper).

## Make one
```bash
# 1. the script: stories/<name>/story.json (lines, chunks, key words), see the pilot
# 2. the narration (Kokoro TTS venv, CPU only, set up once per container: see Setup)
~/.hb-tts/bin/python scripts/voice.py stories/<name>        # -> stories/<name>/voice/<id>.wav + voice.json
# 3. the scenes: stunts/story_<name>.js, one scene per line (copy stunts/story_runaway.js)
STUNT=story_<name> ./run.sh                                  # -> out/story_<name>.mp4
# 4. QA (docs/qa.md) as for every Short, then
node scripts/publish.js story_<name> --pass
```
Re-run `voice.py` after any script change (`--only L03,L07` redoes single lines), then re-run the stunt: the scene
lengths come from voice.json, so a new voice means a new recording.

## Setup (once per container)
```bash
apt-get install -y espeak-ng                     # Kokoro's phonemizer for unknown words
python3.11 -m venv ~/.hb-tts
~/.hb-tts/bin/pip install --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch kokoro soundfile numpy
```
CPU torch only (no CUDA download). The first run fetches the Kokoro-82M weights (Apache 2.0) and spaCy's small
English model. A 17-line story synthesizes in about 30 s on 4 CPUs.

## How it fits together
| piece | file | what |
|---|---|---|
| script | `stories/<name>/story.json` | `lines`: `{"id": "L03", "text": "I tell / the farmer / his wheat / looks GREAT."}`. ` / ` splits caption chunks (2-3 words), CAPS words are key words (drawn in `key_color`, read lower-case so Kokoro doesn't spell them). `gap`: seconds of air after each line. |
| narrator | `scripts/voice.py` | Kokoro `am_adam`, tempo 1.03, sped up 1.45x (pitch up with it): the blocky-stories narrator, ~290 wpm. Writes each line's wav and `voice.json` (each line's `dur`, and every chunk's start/end from Kokoro's word timestamps). |
| timing | `lib/story.js` | `storyLines(dir)`: `line(id).dur`, `line(id).at(k)` (tick where chunk k starts), `gap`. |
| scenes | `stunts/story_<name>.js` | sets every scene up front in `setup` (all mobs NoAI, tagged per scene), then for each line: a cut (teleport), `ctx.mark('line', { id })`, and a per-tick scene function for exactly `dur + gap` seconds. Actions land on a chunk with `at(k)` ("They SLAM" closes the door on that word). |
| edit | `edit.py --story stories/<name>` (from `edit.story`) | lays each line's wav on its `line` mark, draws the captions (`scripts/story_track.py`), and mixes: voice -15 LUFS, game -27, song bed -31, master -14 LUFS. |
| song | `scripts/add_song.py` (via publish.js) | for a story stunt the NCS track is a quiet bed under the voice (-31 LUFS), not the -13 lead the stunt Shorts use. |

Captions: Schibsted Grotesk Black (OFL, `assets/fonts/`) at 96 px, white with a dark outline and a soft shadow,
key words in the story's colour, centred at 70% of the game view's height (under the crosshair, above the
hearts), each chunk popping in on its own first word. The top band keeps the channel's caption (the hook).

## House rules (from blocky-stories RULES.md, the ones that transfer)
- **The first line is a concrete mystery or threat to me, with something countable** ("All FOURTEEN villagers
  in my village RUN when they see ME."), over the picture it describes, in the first second.
- **The twist turns the whole story over,** planted at least twice where a rewatch catches it, and said plainly
  in one short line ("I'm the CREEPER."). The POV camera is the twist machine: who "I" am is never shown.
- **The last line loops into the first** so a replay reads as one sentence ("Which explains why" -> "All
  fourteen villagers...").
- **Something new on screen every 1-2 s, nothing still over 1 s.** One scene per line, a cut on almost every
  line, and inside each scene the camera sways, walks or turns and the cast moves on the line's key word.
- **One quotable line** that's short enough to type ("Even the CHICKENS pack up and LEAVE.").
- **Write like a person:** short sentences, no em dashes or semicolons, US English, no AI words. Fiction,
  never "true story". Nothing aimed at kids in the title or description.
- **Captions 2-3 words, key words in CAPS and colour,** never more than two lines.
- **Leave 0.2-0.3 s between the last word and the end** so the loop cut lands clean.

## Staging lessons (pilot)
- Every scene is built and cast in `setup` and the per-line code only moves things, so a cut costs 1-3 ticks.
  Cast mobs are `NoAI:1b,Silent:1b,Invulnerable:1b` and moved by `/tp` every tick (ops aren't chat-limited).
- Run away from the camera: `execute as @e[tag=T] at @s facing entity <bot> feet rotated ~180 0 positioned ^ ^ ^SPEED
  run tp @s ~ <y> ~ facing ^ ^ ^5`. The recorded yaw follows, because the mob moves every tick.
- Entity moves reach the client a few ticks late: start a scene's motion ~10 ticks before the line's mark if it
  has to be moving on the first frame.
- **mineflayer doesn't move passengers:** a villager riding a boat stays where it mounted in the recording.
  Teleport the boat and the "passenger" side by side instead.
- `face_on` windows are sequential (one open at a time): `face_off` before the next `face_on`.
- A summoned TNT with `fuse:0s` at the camera gives "HelloBuh blew up" on the death screen (a creeper would
  say "was blown up by Creeper"). Set `/difficulty normal` before summoning a creeper, or it's refused.
- No block entities render (beds, bells, chests, signs): build sets without them.

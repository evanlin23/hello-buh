Set up YouTube upload access and a daily upload schedule for my @HelloBuh channel. I'll give you my existing Google OAuth Client ID and Client secret (the blocky-stories one) here in your chat. Use them only by pasting them into the OAuth Playground and into GitHub's secret fields. Secret values (client secret, refresh token, GitHub token) go from one page into another, nothing else. Never repeat them back in this chat, a GitHub issue, a commit or any other page. If anything doesn't match what I describe, stop and tell me instead of guessing. Before each step that needs me (signing in, choosing an account, a 2-step verification prompt), tell me exactly what to click and wait for me.

1. OAuth Playground (https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground):
   a. Gear icon → tick "Use your own OAuth credentials" → paste my Client ID and Client secret. Set Access type: Offline, Force prompt: Consent Screen.
   b. In "Input your own scopes", paste exactly:
      https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly
      Click "Authorize APIs".
   c. When Google asks which account or channel to use, pick the **Hello Buh** channel (@HelloBuh), NOT BuhExplains, Buhtown, Packed, Six Degrees or any other. If you can't tell which is which, stop and ask me. Click through the "Google hasn't verified this app" warning (Advanced → continue): it's my own app.
   d. Click "Exchange authorization code for tokens". Keep the Refresh token in this tab for step 3.
   e. Check: in Step 3, request GET https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/channels?part=snippet&mine=true and confirm the channel title is "Hello Buh" (handle @HelloBuh). Note its "id" (it starts with UC). If it shows any other channel, start step 1 again and pick Hello Buh.

2. GitHub repo evanlin23/hello-buh → Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions: select "Read and write permissions" → Save. (Also make sure Actions are allowed on that page.)

3. GitHub repo evanlin23/hello-buh → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
   - Secrets tab → New repository secret, three times:
     YT_CLIENT_ID = my client ID
     YT_CLIENT_SECRET = my client secret
     YT_REFRESH_TOKEN = the refresh token from step 1d
   - Variables tab → New repository variable:
     YT_CHANNEL_ID = the UC... id from step 1e
   - Do NOT create the variable YT_ENABLED. I'll turn uploads on myself, separately. Until then the daily job runs and does nothing.

4. A GitHub token for the cron service: GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens. If a token named "cron-job.org dispatch" exists, edit it: under Repository access add evanlin23/hello-buh next to the repos already there, keep Repository permissions → Actions: Read and write, and save. (Editing doesn't change its value, so my existing cron-job.org jobs keep working.) Otherwise generate a new token named "cron-job.org hello-buh": Only select repositories → evanlin23/hello-buh, Repository permissions → Actions: Read and write, nothing else, the longest expiry offered.

5. cron-job.org (log into my existing account). If you edited the existing token in step 4, open my existing "buhexplains upload" (or "blocky upload") job and use its Clone action (that copies the headers and token without anyone retyping them). Otherwise create a new job and paste the new token into the Authorization header. The job:
   - Title: hellobuh upload
   - URL: https://api.github.com/repos/evanlin23/hello-buh/actions/workflows/upload.yml/dispatches
   - Schedule: every day at 7:07, time zone America/Chicago
   - Advanced → Request method: POST
   - Headers: Accept: application/vnd.github+json, Authorization: Bearer <the token>, X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28
   - Request body, exactly: {"ref":"main"}
   - Make sure the job is enabled (clones start disabled).
   - Press "Test run" once. A good result is HTTP 204. Uploads are still off (no YT_ENABLED), so the workflow only prints "uploads are off" and does nothing.

6. GitHub repo evanlin23/hello-buh → Actions → "upload-short" → Run workflow → branch main, mode: dry-run → Run. When it finishes, open the run and read me the line that starts with "next:" (the Short it would upload first and its publish time).

7. Finish by telling me which steps you completed, the channel title you confirmed in step 1e, the Test run's HTTP status and the dry-run's "next:" line. Don't include any secret values.
